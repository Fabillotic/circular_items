## IMPORTANT
This resource pack is still very buggy.
Make sure that your Minecraft is at 1080p resolution and your GUI scale is 3!!!
This resource pack is meant for Minecraft version 1.18.1.

## Installation
In the tab "Releases" find the newest release. After downloading the zip file, move it directly into you resourcepacks folder.
You don't have to unzip it!

## Compatibility
Although this resource pack is inspired by [DartCat25](https://github.com/DartCat25/resourcepacks)'s circular hotbar, right now the two aren't compatible without a little coding work.

## Thank you
DartCat25 for making the circular hotbar resource pack
