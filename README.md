## IMPORTANT
This resource pack is still very buggy.
Make sure that your Minecraft is at 1080p resolution and your GUI scale is 3!!!
This resource pack is meant for Minecraft version 1.18.1.

## Installation
In the tab "Releases" find the newest release. After downloading the zip file, move it directly into you resourcepacks folder.
You don't have to unzip it!

## Customizing
To change the position of the hotbar, unzip the zip file and change the values at the top of the file ```assets/minecraft/shaders/include/hotbarstuff.glsl```.
(The ones with ```#define``` at the front)
Zip all the files again, reload the resources and it should work. (A little tinkering is necessary to get the values right.)

## Compatibility
Although this resource pack is inspired by [DartCat25](https://github.com/DartCat25/resourcepacks)'s circular hotbar, right now the two aren't compatible without a little coding work.

## Thank you
DartCat25 for making the circular hotbar resource pack
